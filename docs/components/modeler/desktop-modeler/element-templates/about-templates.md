# Overview

Element templates are a way to extend our Modelers with domain-specific diagram elements, such as service and user tasks. They support Camunda 7 and Camunda 8 and are the foundation of [Camunda 8 Connector Templates](../../../../../components/integration-framework/connectors/custom-built-connectors/connector-templates/).

If applicable, element templates can be assigned to a diagram element via the properties panel.
Once applied, element templates configure the diagram element with pre-defined values for BPMN properties, input/output mappings, and extension properties.

As seen in the _Mail Task_ example above, Modeler allows properties of custom elements to be edited, too.
