While modeling a process, you can click into the Connector Marketplace to browse through Connectors provided by Camunda engineering, discover Connector runtimes developed by Camunda partners, and explore Connector runtimes developed by the Camunda Community.

This may ease your process of selecting which Connectors to integrate into your process, as you can filter by creator, [inbound versus outbound Connectors](/docs/components/connectors/connector-types.md), [runtime](/docs/components/connectors/introduction.md), and Zeebe-compatible versions.

## Visit the Connector Marketplace

To navigate to the Camunda Marketplace, take the following steps:

1. Log in to your Camunda account, and navigate to Web Modeler using the **Camunda apps** icon in the top left corner of your console. Click **Modeler**.
2. Click on an existing project, or create a new project by clicking **New project > Create new file > BPMN Diagram**.
3. Change the type of existing task by clicking on it and using the **wrench-shaped** change type context menu icon, or create a new Connector task by using the **Append Connector** context menu. Follow our [guide to using Connectors](/components/connectors/use-connectors/index.md) to learn more.
4. Click the blue shop icon next to **Change element** to open the Connector Marketplace modal.
5. Browse [available Connectors](/docs/components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/available-connectors-overview.md), tick the boxes on the left side of the modal to implement filters, and search for a specific Connector by typing in the **Search for a connector** search bar.

:::note
Want to learn more about a Connector before applying it to your diagram? Every Connector in the Connector Marketplace offers additional documentation by clicking the **Documentation** link inside the Connector's box. This will open a new tab in your browser of the [Connector Marketplace](https://marketplace.camunda.com/) and additional details for the Connector you selected.

6. Once you find a Connector you want to integrate into your BPMN diagram, click **Download to project**. The resource is then downloaded from the Connector Marketplace.
7. Scroll down in the change type context menu and click on your downloaded Connector to change the type of existing task.

:::note
You can also host custom Connectors developed with [Connector SDK](/docs/components/connectors/custom-built-connectors/connector-sdk.md). Instead of viewing **Download to project**, it may read [**Learn more about self-hosted Connectors**](/docs/guides/host-custom-connector.md).
